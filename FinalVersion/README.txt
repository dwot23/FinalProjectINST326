Extra documentation explaining each file:

classsummaries.csv: Small csv database containing all inst classes along with their summaries. Not a user-input and should always be ran with the program
InformationScienceProgramManager.py: Python file containing program manager code.
studentlist.csv: Demo file of a student that has completed all core classes but is missing some elective classes
studentlist2.csv: Demo file of a student that is still missing both core and elective classes.
studentlist3.csv: Demo file of a student that has completed both core and elective classes.

NOTE: all studentlist csv files are user inputs. The user will typically have to make their own csv file containing their own classes that they have already completed.
